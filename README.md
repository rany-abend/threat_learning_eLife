# Code and data from threat learning modeling paper by Abend, et al. (eLife)
This repository includes two data items from our eLife paper on modeling threat learning.
First, one Excel file with deidentified data for a subsample (n=38, healthy and anxious youth).
The Excel sheet (modeling_data_upload.xlsx) includes 3 sheets:
1. KEY: variable key
2. DATA: trial-by-trial SCR data for each subject
3. DEMOGRAPHICS: additional data for each subject (age, sex, diagnosis, continuous anxiety scores)

These data were uploaded to provide researchers with the opportunity to model this type of data (rapid threat conditioning and extinction). Researchers can use these data freely. All uploaded data are for participants (and parents) who provided assent (consent) to have their deidentified data shared. Subject IDs are not the original study IDs.

Second, we provide the code for implementing the modeling. Please reach out to Diana Burk (diana.burk@nih.gov) with questions concerning the modeling.
